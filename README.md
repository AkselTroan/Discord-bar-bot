# Discord-bar-bot
Discord bot that simulates being at a bar.

Due to covid-19, alot of people are forced to stay at home. We miss having a few beers with the boys at the bar. This is where the Discord-bar bot comes in. This bot will simulate being at the bar with the same fun activity that happens in a bar. 

# Introduction
Start your night at in a voice channel with your mates. Head to the bar with !start. You walk in the bar and start hearing bar ambiance. A bartender is greeting you and asks the group to take a seat. When everyone is seated you tell the bartender that everyone is seated at the table. Then you can start ordering drink but beware the bartender is counting how many drinks you've had and do not like overly drunk people in his bar! If you want to challenge one of your friends at the table to take a shot you can do so. Roll a dice and if the challenger gets a 5 or 6 the victim has to take a shot, however if the challenger gets 1-4 the challenger has to take a shot. The bartender will pour a shot to the loser.    


# Installation
At the time the bot is not running 24/7 on a server so you will need to run it on your own system.
