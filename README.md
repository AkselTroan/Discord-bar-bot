# Discord-bar-bot
Discord bot that is going to simulate being at a bar.

Start your night at in a voice channel with your mates. Head to the bar with !start. You walk in the bar and start hear bar ambiance. A bartender is greeting you and asks the group to take a seat. When everyone is seated you tell the bartender that everyone is seated at the table. Then you can start ordering drink but beware the bartender is counting how many drinks you've had and do not like overly drunk people in his bar! If you want to challenge one of your friends at the table to take a shot you can do so. Roll a dice and if the challenger gets a 5 or 6 the victim has to take a shot, the bartender will pour a shot to the loser.
